## Potential Errors

Errors could arise when bundling TypeScript. The errors could be chalked up to personal choices to get it working on my personal device. Browserify and TSC (TypeScriptCompiler from Microsoft) have great documentation and one should be able to solve any compilation errors by themselves.
